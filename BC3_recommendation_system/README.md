## General Context

### Market Basket Analysis

Nowadays, understanding the purchasing patterns/behaviors of consumers is a
key task for any retail company. Identifying the relationships between the
different types of products, e.g, complementary, substitute, inferior and
convenience goods, provides the company a wholistic view about its customers
and the portfolio of products it has to offer.

Specifically, market basket analysis is a data mining technique that is used
to inform a retailer about products that are frequently bought together, which
of these are seen as substitutes to one another and customer segmentation. The
retailer uses this information to then optimize the store's layout, develop
cross-promotional programs and develop different marketing strategies for its
customers.

### Recommender Systems

Recommender systems have become a very important part of the retail industries
by providing decision-making support to its customers. Several studies such as
Iyengar and Lepper (2000) have proved that when faced with easy choices,
customers tend to buy more. Given the number of possible choices available,
especially for online shopping, having some extra guidance on these choices
can really make a difference and lead to an increase in sales. As an example,
35% of Amazon sales come from recommendations. Moreover, recommender systems
are a useful alternative to search algorithms since they help users discover
items they might not find otherwise.

Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering
and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model
from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or
numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by
other users. It relies solely on user/ item interaction data. In the opposite
side, content-based filtering relies on item attribute data and it uses this
kind of data to recommend items with similar properties to the ones a user has
liked in the past. Modern recommender systems typically combine one or more
approaches into a hybrid system.

There are two kinds of user/ item interaction data available: explicit and
implicit.
- Explicit: A score, such as a rating or a like 
- Implicit: Not as obvious in terms of preference, such as a click, view, or
  purchase

The most common example of explicit data discussed is movie ratings, which are
given on a numeric scale. We can easily see whether a user enjoyed a movie
based on the rating provided. The problem, however, is that most of the time,
people don’t provide ratings at all, so the amount of explicit data available
is quite scarce. Sometimes we get access to data about certain interactions
between users and items that give us some degree of certainty on whether a
user likes an item - this is what we call implicit data. With implicit data,
the more interactions a user has with an item, the more certain we are about
its preference. A common example might be viewing a product in Amazon's
website or even purchasing it.

## Business Situation 

Gift-a-Lot is a UK-based and registered non-store online retailer with about
80 members of staff. The company was established in 1981 mainly selling unique
all-occasion gifts. For years in the past, the merchant relied heavily on
direct mailing catalogues, and orders were taken over phone calls. It was only
2 years ago that the company launched its own web site and shifted completely
to the web. Since then the company has maintained a steady and healthy number
of customers from all parts of the United Kingdom and the world, and has
accumulated a huge amount of data about many customers. The company also uses
Amazon.co.uk to market and sell its products. 

Jane, Gift-a-Lot's newly appointed Chief data officer, has a small team of
in-house data scientists, with little time to dedicate to new projects.
Consequently, she decided to hire a team of external consultants (you) to
address some of the questions they've been struggling to address.

With the data they provided the company expects to build a recommender system
that is able to facilitate user choices by recommending items the user likes
and improve user experience when making purchases on its website. A particular
challenge is the cold start problem - how can we suggest relevant items to new
customers?

The customer transaction dataset held by the merchant has 8 variables as shown
below, and it contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and
09/12/2011. Over that particular period, there were 25900 valid transactions
in total, associated with 4070 unique items and 4372 customers from 38
different countries. The dataset has 541909 instances, each for a particular
item contained in a transaction. In addition, it is important to note that many of
Gift-a-Lot customers are wholesalers.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Explore the data and build models to answer the problems:
    1. Market Basket Analysis: Which types of products can be seen as
       substitutes and complementary?  What are the main types of consumer
       behavior in the business?
    2. Recommender system: the website homepage offers a wide range of
       products the user might be interested in
    3. Cold start: offer relevant products to new customers
2. Implement adequate evaluation strategies and select an appropriate quality
   measure
3. In the deployment phase, elaborate on the challenges and recommendations in
   implementing the recommender system
